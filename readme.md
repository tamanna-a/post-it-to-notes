This project is a way to convert an image of post-it notes and extract the texts.

The machine learning component involves a number of Computer Vision tasks, namely **line segmentation** and **Handwriting Text Recognition.** 
The front-end of the app is built in flask, it allows the user to upload a post it note.

**ML-Sub-Problems**
I separated the ML problem into 3 components.

1. Pre-Processing Post-It notes into a similar format as the training data
2. Segmenting lines in the post-it into lines 
3. Lines to text â€”> Easter2 Model

For Pre-processing, I used OpenCV's functions.
The line to text part was built by applying the Easter2 model, which is currently the SOTA non-transformer model. 

Below are some resources used to aid in the project. 

**Dataset**:
IAM (IAM Handwriting)
- 13,353 images of handwritten lines of text created by 657 writers
- writers transcribed text from Lancaster-Oslo/Bergen Corpus of British English
- total of 1,539 handwritten pages 
- 115,320 words
- The database is labeled at the sentence, line, and word levels
- Dataset paper: The IAM-database: an English sentence database for offline handwriting recognition
